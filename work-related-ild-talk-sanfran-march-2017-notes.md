ardystil repeat outbreak in algeria:
late 1992
5 cases of interstitial lung disease among 12 textile
printing workers (1 fatal)
• air-spraying with “products from Spain”

add more on what indium is - it's a relatively rare element used as a metal in alloys for electronics applications
what's a ball mill?

what meant by household clustering in south korean lung? 6 cases belonged to household clusters (e.g had a partner or children also affected)

?story about infective aetiology? initially viral infection suspected because of recent viral epidemics e.g avian flu, sars, and H1N1 - not supported by extensive micro workup

was a case-control study

case definition 
(1) bilateral, centrilobular or diffuse
ground glass opacities observed on high-resolution CT (HRCT);
(2) the patients had symptoms or signs not consistent with other
clinical diagnoses; and 
(3) the patients were young adults aged
20–54 years.

odds ratio for humidifier disinfectant = was 47.3 (95% CI 6.05 - 369.7) in case-control study (note case series and case-control study published separately) 

clinic presentation like hypersensitivity pneumonitis or acute interstital pneumonia but radiology and pathology didn't fit

clinical, radiological, and pathological features similar to outbreak of ILD seen in kids prompted further case-control study

Park JH, Gwack J, et al. Inhalation toxicity of humidifier disinfectants
as a risk factor of children’s interstitial lung disease in Korea: a case-
control study. PLoS ONE 2013;8:e64430.

case definition
1) be 18 years of age or less;
2) show rapidly progressive
respiratory distress; and 
3) demonstrate
radiologic evidence of diffuse or
centrilobular ground-glass opacities and/or
air leak syndrome, such as pneumothorax,
pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous
emphysema.

for korean lung in adults and children case series then case-control

(add that ardystil and indium case control studies - if they were)
