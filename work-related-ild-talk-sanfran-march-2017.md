# What is work-related ILD? 

## Definitions

## work-related doesn't mean occupational

##

- occupational diseases are primarily caused by exposure to risk factors arising from work
- work-related diseases have multiple causes; factors in workplace may play a role 
(WHO 2017)

## diffuse parenchymal lung disease is confusing

##

- ILD or DPLD
- hetrogeneous group of disorders characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the interstitum
- interstitum refers to tissue between the pulmonary alveoli and the bloodstream
- in practice disease can also involve airway

## lung physiology and interstitial exposures 

## 

- Diffusion of gases across blood-gas barrier is passive and govenerned by Fick's Law.

##

![Weibel model](images/Weibelmodel.jpg){ width=65% }

##

> Vgas (diffusing) is proportional to Area/Thickness * D(diffusion constant) * (P1 - P2)

D = solubility / root of the molecular weight of the gas

##

- 2μm across (for ref sheet of paper is 50μm, 1/20th of a mm or 0.05mm)
- 25x thinner than that. 300 million alveloli 
- Each alveoli is 0.0042mm^3 (a grain of sand is 0.06mm^3, so an alveoli is about 14 times smaller) 
- Surface area of a tennis court

## 

> TV 500ml, dead space 150ml, RR 15/min, 350ml*15 = approx 5L/min -> 7200L/day 

## ample opportunity for sufficiently small particles to meet the interstitum 

## work-related ILD

## ILD incidence 30/100,000 per year and Prevelance 70/100,000 (approximately)

##

- precise population prevalence and incididence of ILD hard to establish (classification 
problems, limitations of registry and insurance claim data)
- best historic estimate of incidence 30/100,000 per year, prevelance 70/100,000 (10)
- IIP most common, IPF 1/3rd of cases, more common in men

## 15-20\% of ILD due to occupational and environmental exposures

## aetiologies are many  

##

- common: include organic antigen, isocyanates, silica, cadium, diacetyl, asbestos
- less common: cobalt, rare earths, plutonium 

## relationship between aetiolgic agent and pathological patten often not 1:1

##

## 

## don't worry we'll look at histology slides shortly

## Clinical features 

- Respiratory symptoms with an appropriate occupational or environmental exposure history 
- Host-factor (e.g adaptive immune response, systemic) vs exposure factor dominant presentations (local inflammatory response)
- Investigations

## Attribution frequently non-trivial

## New workplace and environmental exposures all the time

![A hierarchy of attribution in occupational lung diseases (11)](images/Attribution.jpg){ width=90% }

# I can't cover it all

## I'll cover three chemicals that cause diseases where the hard work of attribution has already been done

##

1. Ardystil 
2. Indium tin oxide
3. South Korean lung 

# Ardystil

##

- April 1992, two young women who worked at a textile factory were treated for interstital lung disease and severe pulmonary insufficiency in Valencia
- Prompted investigation of all textile factories using same spraying technique in the area
- 257 employees identified. 22 cases who met radiological and biopsy criteria for orangising pneumonia. Six fatal cases.
- Epidemiological analysis revealed COP-like response due to chemical Acramin (trade name Ardystyl) 

## 

![Chemical structure of Acramin FWN and Acramin FWR (12)](images/Acramin.png){ width=65% }

##

- Acramin FWR recently introduced as a replacement for Acramin FWN at the two factories where majority of cases had worked. 
- Animal studies confirmed respiratory toxicity.
- Thought that highly negatively charged long-chain molecular structure of Acramin FWN contributes causes toxicity.

# Indium tin oxide

##

- Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a sintered material used in making crystal displays for televisions and computers.
- First case of ITO-associated interstitial pneumonitis was reported in 2003 in a 27-year-old Japanese worker (1)
- Case series confirm interstital pneumonia similar to UIP, emphyema, PAP in indium workers. (13) 
- Like ardystil outbreak notable that cases are young, have severe respiratory disease, and colleagues who are also unwell.

# South Korean Lung

##

- From 2006 epidemics of fatal lung injury in children were observed in Korea every spring (14).
- Clinical characteristics of suspected cases between 2006-2011 were reviewed and association with humidifer disinfectant use made.
- 138 cases, average age 30.4 months. 80 children died.
- No new cases following humidifier disinfectant ban in 2011.
