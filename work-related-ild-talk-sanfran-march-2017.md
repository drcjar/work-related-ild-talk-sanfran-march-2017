# What is work-related ILD? 

## Definitions

## work-related doesn't mean occupational

##

- occupational diseases are primarily caused by exposure to risk factors arising from work
- work-related diseases have multiple causes; factors in workplace may play a role 
(WHO 2017)

## diffuse parenchymal lung disease is confusing

##

- ILD or DPLD
- heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the interstitium
- interstitium refers to tissue between the pulmonary alveoli and the bloodstream
- in practice disease can also involve airway

## lung physiology and interstitial exposures 

## 

- Diffusion of gases across blood-gas barrier is passive and governed by Fick's Law.

##

![Weibel model](images/Weibelmodel.jpg){ width=50% }

##

> Vgas (diffusing) is proportional to Area/Thickness * D(diffusion constant) * (P1 - P2)

D = solubility / root of the molecular weight of the gas

- 2μm across (for ref sheet of paper is 50μm, 1/20th of a mm or 0.05mm). (17)
- 25x thinner than that. 300 million alveolii. 
- Each alveoli is 0.0042mm^3 (a grain of sand is 0.06mm^3, so an alveoli is about 14 times smaller).(16) Surface area of a tennis court.
- basic tripartate layout highly conserved throughout evolutionary history (alveolar epithelium, ECM, capillary endothelium, seen American lungfish arising some 400 million years ago) (18)

## 

> TV 500ml, dead space 150ml, RR 15/min, 350ml*15 = approx 5L/min -> 7200L/day 

## ample opportunity for sufficiently small particles to meet the interstitium 

## 

- particles > 2μm in diameter deposit in the larger airways
- particles 1-2μm the smaller conducting airways
- particles 0.1-1μm deposit in the alveolar-interstitial region

## {data-background="images/particles.png"}

##

- the 0.1-1μm range includes paint pigments, metal dusts, and humidifier particles   
- responses to exposure can be divided e.g irritant/fibrotic/allergic/infectious/carcinogenic

## work-related ILD

## ILD incidence 30/100,000 per year 

## ILD prevalence 70/100,000 

##

- precise population prevalence and incidence of ILD hard to establish (classification 
problems, limitations of registry and insurance claim data).
- best historic estimate of incidence 30/100,000 per year, prevalence 70/100,000. (10)
- IIP most common, IPF 1/3rd of cases, more common in men.

## 15-20\% of ILD due to occupational and environmental exposures

## aetiologies are many  

##

- common: include organic antigen, isocyanates, silica, cadium, diacetyl, asbestos
- less common: cobalt, rare earths, plutonium

## Clinical features 

- Respiratory symptoms with an appropriate occupational or environmental exposure history 
- Host-factor (e.g adaptive immune response, systemic) vs exposure factor dominant presentations (local inflammatory response)
- Investigations

## Attribution frequently non-trivial

## New workplace and environmental exposures all the time

# Recent outbreaks

## Three recent outbreaks 

##

1. Ardystil 
2. Indium tin oxide
3. South Korean lung 

# Ardystil

## 

- April 1992, two young women who worked at a textile factory were treated for interstitial lung disease and severe pulmonary insufficiency in Valencia.
- Prompted investigation of all textile factories (A-H) using same spraying technique in the area
- 257 employees identified. 22 cases who met radiological and biopsy criteria for organising pneumonia. Six fatal cases.

##

- Factory A had the highest risk of being a case (RR=24.3; 95% Cl=5.7-104.4),
followed by Factory B (RR=11, 95% CI=11.9- 62.9) and only two out of 22 cases
had never worked in factories A or B. 
- It was found that only in factories A and B had the presence of an airborne chemical by the trade name Acramin FWR that had recently been substituted with another related compound Acramin
FWN. 
- Subsequently a similar outbreak occurred in Algeria.

![Chemical structure of Acramin FWN and Acramin FWR (12)](images/Acramin.png){ width=65% }

##

- Acramin FWR (tradname Ardystil) recently introduced as a replacement for Acramin FWN at the two factories where majority of cases had worked. 
- Animal studies confirmed respiratory toxicity.
- Thought that highly negatively charged long-chain molecular structure of Acramin FWN contributes causes toxicity.

# Indium tin oxide

##

- Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a sintered material used in making crystal displays for televisions and computers.
- First case of ITO-associated interstitial pneumonitis was reported in 2003 in a 27-year-old Japanese worker (1)
- Cases in Japan, US, and China confirm interstitial pneumonia similar to UIP, emphysema, PAP in indium workers. Two patients have died to date. (13) 
- Like Ardystil outbreak notable that cases are young, have severe respiratory disease, and colleagues who are also unwell.

# South Korean Lung

##

![''A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has received a seven-year prison sentence over a humidifier disinfectant linked to the death of around 100 people''. BBC News website (accessed Jan 17 2017)](images/Disinfectant.jpg){ width=65% }

##

- Household clustering was observed in a series of patients admitted to ICU with severe respiratory distress in the spring of 2011. (15)
- Case series consisted of 17 patients (15 of which were female) with median age 35. Six were pregnant at presentation. 
- All presented with cough and dyspnoea. CT showed patchy consolidation followed by ground glass opacity and bronchiolocentric fibrotic changes.  
- Ten patients required mechanical ventilation. Four had lung transplants. Five of the six who did not have a lung transplant died.

##

- An infective aetiology was initially suspected.
- Epidemiological investigation (a hospital based case-control study) revealed that all patients had used humidifier disinfectant in their homes. 
- It transpired that children had also been affected.

##

- From 2006 epidemics of fatal lung injury in children were observed in Korea every spring (14).
- Clinical characteristics of suspected cases between 2006-2011 were reviewed and association with humidifier disinfectant use made.
- 138 cases, average age 30.4 months. 80 children died.
- No new cases following humidifier disinfectant ban in 2011. 

##

- Mechanism by which polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate, poly(oxyalkylene guanidine) hydrochloride, chloromethylisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (toxic materials within humidifier disinfectant) not yet known. 
- Avoidable? Writing about 'Humidifier fever' in Parke's third edition (1994) Pickering stated (use of humidifier biocides) "should be discouraged because we have no knowledge of the effects of long-term exposure to this group of chemicals"

# Summary 

##

1. Occupational and environmental exposures change over time giving risk to new disease outbreaks; the interstitium is vulnerable 
2. Recent occupational and environmental interstitial lung disease outbreaks include Ardystil, Indium tin oxide, and South Korean lung
3. The relationship between exposures and pathological patterns is frequently not 1:1
4. Stay vigilant
