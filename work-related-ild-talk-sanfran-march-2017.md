# What is work-related ILD? 

## Definitions

## work-related doesn't mean occupational

- work-related != occupational
- occupational diseases are primarily caused by exposure to risk factors arising from work
- work-related diseases have multiple causes; factors in workplace may play a role 
(WHO 2017)

## diffuse parenchymal lung disease is confusing

- ILD or DPLD
- hetrogeneous group of disorders characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the interstitum
- interstitum refers to tissue between the pulmonary alveoli and the bloodstream
- in practice disease can also involve airway

## lung physiology and interstitial exposures 

- Diffusion of gases across blood-gas barrier is passive and govenerned by Fick's Law.

##

![Weibel model](images/Weibelmodel.jpg){ width=65% }

##

> Vgas (diffusing) is proportional to Area/Thickness * D(diffusion constant) * (P1 - P2)

D = solubility / root of the molecular weight of the gas

##

- 2μm across (for ref sheet of paper is 50μm, 1/20th of a mm or 0.05mm)
- 25x thinner than that. 300 million alveloli 
- Each alveoli is 0.0042mm^3 (a grain of sand is 0.06mm^3, so an alveoli is about 14 times smaller) 
- Surface area of a tennis court

## 

> TV 500ml, dead space 150ml, RR 15/min, 350ml*15 = approx 5L/min -> 7200L/day 

## ample opportunity for sufficiently small particles to meet the interstitum

## work-related ILD

## Epidemiology

- precise population prevalence and incididence of ILD hard to establish (classification 
problems, limitations of registry and insurance claim data)
- best historic estimate of incidence 30/100,000 per year, prevelance 70/100,000(10)
- IIP most common, IPF 1/3rd of cases, more common in men

## estimated 15-20\% of ILD due to occupational and environmental exposures


## Aetiologies are many  

- diverse, relationship with pathologic pattern usually not 1:1
- common: include organic antigen, isocyanates, silica, cadium, diacetyl, asbestos
- less common: cobalt, rare earths, plutonium 

## Relationship between aetiolgic agent and pathological patten often not 1:1

## Don't worry we'll look at histology slides shortly

## Clinical features 

- Respiratory symptoms with an appropriate occupational or environmental exposure history 
- Attribution frequently non-trivial

# But I'm not covering it all

## I'll cover three chemicals that cause disease

##

1. Ardystil 
2. Indium tin oxide
3. South Korean lung 

# Ardystil

## {data-background="images/colophon1.jpg"}

# Indium tin oxide

## {data-background="images/colophon3.jpg"}

# South Korean Lung

## {data-background="images/colophon4.jpg"}

# MCQs

## Which of the three chemical exposures causing ILD was not work-related?

##

 A) Ardytstil
 B) Indium tin oxide
 C) South Korean lung

##

# Summary 

##

1. Occupational and environmental exposures change of time giving risk to new diseases 
2. Interstitial lung disease examples include Ardystil, Indium tin oxide, and South Korean lung
3. Stay vigilant
