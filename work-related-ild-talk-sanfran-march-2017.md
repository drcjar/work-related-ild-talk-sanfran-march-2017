# What is work-related ILD? 

## Definitions

## work-related

- work-related != occupational
- occupational diseases are primarily caused by exposure to risk factors arising from work
- work-related diseases have multiple causes; factors in workplace may play a role 
- (WHO 2017)

## diffuse parenchymal lung disease

- ILD or DPLD
- hetrogeneous group of disorders characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the interstitum
- interstitum refers to tissue between the pulmonary alveoli and the bloodstream
- in practice disease can also involve airway

-2 micrometers across (for ref sheet of paper is 50micrometers), so thats 25x thinner than that. surface area that of a tennis court.
necessary for O2 flow rate of 3L per minute.

# I'm not covering it all

## I'll cover three chemicals that cause disease

##

1. Ardystil 
2. Indium tin oxide
3. South Korean lung

# Indium tin oxide

# South Korean Lung

## {data-background="images/colophon4.jpg"}

# MCQs

## Which of the three chemical exposures causing ILD was not work-related?

##

 A) Ardytstil
 B) Indium tin oxide
 C) South Korean lung

##

# Summary 

##

1. Occupational and environmental exposures change of time giving risk to new diseases 
2. Interstitial lung disease examples include Ardystil, Indium tin oxide, and South Korean lung
3. Stay vigilant
